# KamiCode

KamiCode is an agent-harness control surface for Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok Build, and OpenCode.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> KamiCode currently supports Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok Build, and OpenCode.
> Install and authenticate at least one provider before use:
>
> - Codex: install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and run `codex login`
> - Claude: install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and run `claude auth login`
> - Cursor: install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) and run `agent login`
> - Grok Build: install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli) and run `grok login`
> - OpenCode: install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and run `opencode auth login`

### Try it out (install-free)

The easiest way to test T3 Code is to run the server in your terminal (requires Node.js 22.16+, 23.11+, or 24.10+):

```bash
npx t3@latest
```

This will launch T3 Code's backend on your machine as well as the local web app to control your agents.

Tip: Use `npx t3@latest --help` for the full CLI reference.

### Desktop app

Install the latest version of the desktop app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/camie-ace/KamiCode/releases).

Direct Windows x64 installer link:

```bash
https://github.com/camie-ace/KamiCode/releases/latest/download/KamiCode-Setup-x64.exe
```

Maintainers can publish a release by pushing a version tag like `v0.1.0`. See [docs/distribution.md](./docs/distribution.md).

The package-registry install options below are inherited from upstream T3 Code and are not KamiCode distribution channels yet:

#### Windows (`winget`)

```bash
winget install T3Tools.T3Code
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install --cask t3-code
```

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S t3code-bin
```

### Install `vp`

KamiCode uses Vite+ (inherited from upstream T3 Code) so you'll need to install the global `vp` command-line tool.

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash
```

#### Windows

```bash
irm https://vite.plus/ps1 | iex
```

Checkout their getting started guide for more information: https://viteplus.dev/guide/

### Install dependencies

```bash
vp i
```
